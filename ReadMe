Intranet Communication Service

A Spring Boot–based intranet messaging service that enables controlled communication between Controller and Terminal roles, with message persistence, state tracking, and a minimal dashboard UI for demo purposes.

How to Run
Prerequisites

Java 17+

Maven

Git

Steps
git clone https://github.com/Arjungandla07/intranet-communication-service.git
cd intranet-communication-service
mvn clean spring-boot:run


Backend runs on: http://localhost:8080

UI dashboard: http://localhost:8080/index.html

Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs
1. Role-based communication

Explicit Controller and Terminal roles

Prevents invalid bidirectional messaging

Trade-off: Slightly more backend logic, but clearer business rules

2. State-based messaging

Backend exposes current state separately from message history

UI fetches state explicitly instead of inferring from last message

Trade-off: Extra API endpoint, but avoids UI inconsistencies

3. Simple REST over WebSockets

REST APIs used for messaging and polling

Trade-off: No real-time push, but simpler, more predictable, and easier to test/demo

4. Minimal frontend

Static HTML/JS dashboard for demo clarity

Trade-off: Not production-grade UI, but keeps focus on backend design

5. Testable service layer

Business logic isolated in services

Unit tests use Mockito with repository mocking

Trade-off: No full integration tests yet

What I’d Improve With More Time

Add WebSocket support for real-time updates

Introduce integration tests (Testcontainers + H2/Postgres)

Improve frontend UX (React/Vue dashboard)

Add authentication tokens instead of basic auth

Add message ordering guarantees and retries

Deploy via Docker with environment-based configs
